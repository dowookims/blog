>Do not go gentle into that good night,  
>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>
>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
>Because their words had forked no lightning they  
>Do not go gentle into that good night.

>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
